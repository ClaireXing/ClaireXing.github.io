	<p>Hi, I'm Xiaoyue Xing and welcome to my homepage. </p>

	<p>Aperiodically, I share some projects or blogs here with you including my research works, academic thoughts about interesting phenomena in cities and 
		useful techniques in geographical spatial-temporal analysis. 
		If you enjoy any of the issues I post feel free to contact with me.</p>

	<p>I received the B.S. degree from Beijing Normal University, China, in 2018. I am currently working toward the doctorâ€™s degree in School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, China.</p>
